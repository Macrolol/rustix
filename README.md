Experimenting building a unix kernel in rust

I am not qualified to write a kernel but I'm trying anyway.

I am currently reading "The design of the unix operating system" and I've decided 
to follow along in the implementation of the kernal using rust.

I am new to rust as well as systems programming but I am very interested in learning 
more about it. 

If you have anythiing you think I should know by looking at the code
in this repository I would love to hear from you. I appreciate all feedback on the project
as my main focus is to improve as a programmer



This is a hobby/resume project and I don't expect it to be fully functional anytime soon
