Eperimenting building a unix kernel in rust

I am not qualified to write a kernel but I'm trying anyway.

I am currently reading "The design of the unix operating system" and I've decided 
to follow along in the implementation of the kernal using rust.

I am new to rust as well as systems programming but I am very interested in learning 
more about it. 

At the moment all that I've made is an impementation of the buffer cache as descibed in
the unix book.

If you have anything you think I should know by looking at the code
in this repository I would love to hear from you. I appreciate all feedback on the project
as my main focus is to improve as a programmer



This is a hobby/resume project and I don't expect it to be fully functional anytime soon
